# PortFolio Experience by Loïc Zeiss

A visual experience of a terminal-like PortFolio.

# Concept

Accessing the site, you face a draw of a "Cyber-punk" styled
capsule room, in which a young person is represented seated on a
floor-bed. The subject has Tech implants in the head, thats permits
to access his "consciousness". You may then enter the "help" command 
in the input to access deepeer layers of his brain. 
You'll discover a serie of possible inputs, which will permits you to access 
my personnal information, as well as Dev Projects I did.
